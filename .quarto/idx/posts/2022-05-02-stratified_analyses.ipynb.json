McCarroll and W. Haddon Jr, 1962).\nThe data was stratified by marital status, which was believed to be a possible confounder.\nThe exposure was blood alcohol level of 100mg% or greater.\nCases were drivers who were killed in car accidents for which they were considered to be responsible, and controls were selected drivers passing the locations where the accidents of the cases occurred, at the same time of day and on the same day of the week.\n\nThe results were as follows.\n\n| Married             | cases (+)   | controls (-) |\n| ------------------- | ----------: | -----------: |\n| **exposed (+)**     | 4           | 5            |\n| **not exposed (-)** | 5           | 103          |\n\n| Not married         | cases (+)   | controls (-) |\n| ------------------- | ----------: | -----------: |\n| **exposed (+)**     | 10          | 3            |\n| **not exposed (-)** | 5           | 43           |\n\nThe tables were initialised as two NumPy `NDArrays`, one for each stratum/level.\nThe analysis was performed using two classes from StatsModels: `StratifiedTable`[^1] and `Table2x2`.[^2]\nThe results were outputted to either a Pandas `Series` or `DataFrame`, depending on the dimensionality of the result.\n(This is optional, and done so to provide a standardised output.)\n\nThese topics are covered in M249, Book 1, Part 2.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n## Global constants\n\nThese are the results from the study.\n\n## Main\n\n### Initialise the contingency tables\n\n### Odds ratios\n\n#### Stratum-specific odds ratios \n\n#### Crude odds ratio\n\n#### Adjusted odds ratio (Mantel–Haenszel odds ratio)\n\n### Test for no association\n\nThis is the Mantel–Haenszel test.\n\n### Test for homogeneity\n\nThis is Tarone's test.\n\n## References\n\nMcCarroll, J.R. and Haddon Jr, W., 1962.
