This ordering principle is sometimes called LIFO, last-in first-out.*\n> *It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.*\n>\n> [What is a Stack?](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds/BasicDS/WhatisaStack.html) (Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python)\n\nThe Stack ADT....\n\n| operation  | description                           | signature                 |\n| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| *new*      | Initialise an empty stack             | `Stack()`                 |\n| *is empty* | Return if the stack contains no items | `is_empty() -> bool`      |\n| *push*     | Add `x` to the top of the stack       | `push(x: object) -> None` |\n| *peek*     | Return the top item of the stack       | `peek() -> object`       |\n| *pop*      | Remove the top item from the stack    | `pop() -> None`           |\n\n## Class\n\n## Example usage\n\nInitialise a new stack.\n\nPopulate a stack.\n\nCheck if stack is empty.\n\nPeek at the top of the stack.\n\nEmpty the stack.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"output-file":"2022-05-26-stack_adt.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.339","theme":"../ember.scss","title-block-banner":false,"title":"Stack ADT","author":"LaughingRook","date":"2022-05-26","categories":["adt"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
